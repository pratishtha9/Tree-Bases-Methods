The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania
trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the
Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised
air that are utilized in various functions in a truck,
such as braking and gear changes. The datasets'
positive class consists of component failures
for a specific component of the APS system.
The negative class consists of trucks with failures
for components not related to the APS. The data consists
of a subset of all available data, selected by experts.
